Lack of data for the project - early fail no worries
Fail to turn a business problem into a Data Science use case.
Fail to gather requirements
Fail to define target variable and train data appropriately ( Do you know what you want to know?)
Fail to follow single universally agreed sequential order

1. Gather requirements
2. Gather potentially relevant data
3. Structure data and target variable
4. Explore
5. Re-evaluate all assumptions made and re-iterate 2-5
6. Pick single performance metric
7. Build model 
8. Error Analysis and re-iterate 2, 3 , 4,5,7
9. Deploy in Prod
10. Monitor model

Fail to plan for prediction in production when building a model offline
Fail to Move beyond predictions
